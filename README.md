# Notes

- ***USE AT YOUR OWN RISK***
- Reads your ee.log, which contains sensitive information (like your IP), however none of that is used in the program nor is it sent anywhere. If you don't feel comfortable, read the code or just don't use it
- Made for 100% UI scale, no guarantees about other settings
- Only works for Windows
- Uses image recognition, will probably not get you banned
